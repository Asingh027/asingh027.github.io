<h3>Predict Future Sales Kaggle Competition (R)</h3>
<p>This is the final project for CS 636.
    During this project, we forecasted the next month's total sales via Simple Linear Regression and
    Multiple Linear Regression
    machine learning models. We discerned the 2 optimal features for our predictive model by using
    Sequential Forward Selection.

<h3>Twitter Sentiment Analysis via Spark Streaming (Python)</h3>
<p>This is the final project for CS 644.
    For this project, we utilized Twitter's API to fetch relevant tweets and classify sentiment as
    positive (4) or
    negative (0) via the Spark Mlib Python package. Next, we trained a Logistic Regression model to
    perform sentiment
    analysis on 1,600,000-row dataset. Finally, we stored the fetched tweets' data and
    classification results to an external database.
    Our Logistic Regression model yielded a ROC accuracy of 82.6%.

<h3>Equity Portfolio Management (R)</h3>
<p>This is the final project for CS 644.
    This is the Midterm project for CS 636. The purpose of this assignment was to demonstrate a
    strong
    understanding of R, along with data manipulation and analysis. We calculated mark-to-market
    values for 5-day Buy High
    and 5-day Buy Low investment strategies for 5 technology stocks. Next, we compared the final MTM
    for these two strategies
    with a High-Tech index, converted the values from USD to JPY, and generated updated MTM values.
    Finally, we found the
    optimal investment strategy that yielded the highest MTM value. Strategy: Buy Low. Interval = 21
    days, MTM = $5,711,743.

<h3>K-Means MapReduce Development and Execution via AWS EC2 Instance (Python)</h3>
<p>The purpose of this assignment was to demonstrate an understanding of utilizing AWS and Python to
    run MapReduce tasks.
    We were required to initialize and configure the Hadoop environment via AWS EC2 with Java,
    Spark, and Python installations.
    Next, we generated ~9,000 (X,Y) coordinates based on 3 predetermined initial centroids. Finally,
    we developed and executed a K-Means
    MapReduce class via MRjob to discover the centroids of the clusters.

<h3>Predictive Modeling for FDA Approval of Phase III Drug-Indication Pairs (Python)</h3>
<p>This is my Senior Project from Stevens Institute of Technology. The purpose of the project was to
    prove that it was possible
    to predict whether or not the FDA would approve a drug based on previous assessments. First, we
    manually accumulated and polished
    a 606-row dataset with 9 features in order to quantify and analyze key features. Finally, we
    executed statistical analyses via
    binary classifiers (Gaussian, Zero-R) and ML-supervised model (5-fold 3NN, Random Forest,
    Logistic Regression) to test hypothesis,
    determine correlation, and develop solutions. Our initial model was flawed, as our data was
    insufficient, biased, and incomplete. Moving
    forward, we would focus on gathering a proper dataset.
